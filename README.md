## Description

This is a Dungeons And Dragons (DnD) companion app built to assist both the Dungeon Master (DM) and their players take and share notes associated with their present campaigns.

## Usage

Note that in order to use the app, a user must make an account.

Once an account is created a user acting as a DM can can create a campaign, with which they can invite players, create and share notes.
